      <h2>RC Navigation & Mapping</h2>
      <img src="/assets/imgs/rcav.PNG" alt="s1" style="width:1000px;height:300px;">
      <h4>Navigation</h4>
      <p>The navigation is admittedly rather simple, but it can explore a pathway/building completely independently, without crashing.  It also manages speed depending on the situation (i.e. slower when turning or when there is a wall ahead).</p>
      <h4><a href="https://github.com/BHS-AV/AV_Algorithm/blob/master/Scripts/Map.py">Mapping</a></h4>
      <p>This is the portion I have been most passionate about, as evidenced by the file’s line count (2280 lines of code). For the first couple of months, I used the lidar to take in data and find a “line-of-best-fit” between data-points, thus creating various walls.  However, it was inefficient, and when a driving algorithm is inefficient, crashes are rather frequent. Eventually, I devised a new system, instead of making lines, I would treat the individual data-points as nodes.  Once the data was taken in, the nodes were strung together, and unnecessary nodes were removed.  This system is able to drive around a track, taking in well over eight thousand data-points, and create an accurate map of a mere forty nodes.</p>
      <h4><a href="https://github.com/mikedillender/Gazebo-Map-Gen">Map Generation</a></h4>
      <p>After nearly a year of working on the project, I decided that for better software testing, I would need more virtual maps to demo in— but there were none online. So, I decided to make a rather basic script to randomly generate a map for the car to test in.</p>

      <h3>Shopping Cart</h3>
      <img src="/assets/imgs/cart.PNG" alt="s1" style="width:700px;height:350px;">
      <p>I made this a couple of months ago, and it is pretty much my only large-scale project that involves much hardware. The original idea was born from a desire to take my team’s work in Autonomous Vehicles to the next level, but that never really worked out with my teacher. So it became a passion project until I finished it after a couple of weeks. I found the cart abandoned in the woods near my house, and using some electronics from my basement, managed to power it with electric motors. Eventually, I managed to make it controllable via a python script on my laptop.</p>

      <h2>3D Function Visualizer</h2>
      <img src="/assets/imgs/fxvis.PNG" alt="s1" style="width:600px;height:600px;">
      <p>This project originated as a 3D particle simulator (#4), but soon progressed into an experiment with 3D functions. I realized that if I created a 2D-float-array, I could use the value of each index as the z-position, and the two array indexes as the x and y. Hence, by inputting a simple z=f(x,y) function, it could create a 3D rendering of it by drawing lines to adjacent indexes.</p>
      <p>The first problem I had with this was how to handle 3D-rotations of perspective, and since I was unable to find much helpful information on how to use quaternions, I struggled with making it work.  However, I eventually just settled on the admittedly inefficient method of rotationally-translating each point around the origin every render.</p>
      <p>Eventually, while doing schoolwork, I realized I could alter my original method to graph polar functions. By replacing the float-array with a vector-array, I could instead have the array indexes represent the x-y orientation from the origin and store the x-y positions in the vector.  This worked surprisingly well, and after I made an algorithm to panel the graphs and render them in order of distance from the observer, I started to realize the potential this program had.</p>
      <p>Finally, I upgraded it to render parametric equations by using the x-index as a fourth variable, time. First, I made basic parametric functions with {x=f(t), y=g(t), z=h(t)}, but later added  Euler approximation compatibility, using the y-index as a different initial position, with the input parameter being the derivative functions of each position variable.</p>

      <h2>3D Particle Simulator</h2>
      <img src="/assets/imgs/particle.PNG" alt="s1" style="width:100%;height:100%;">
      <p>I had made several particle simulators prior to this one, but since they were all 2D, I was always annoyed with my inability to model electromagnetism. Since electromagnetism is an inherently 3D force, as demonstrated by the right-hand rule, I knew I had to make a 3D-environment. So, I made this using Java’s Applet graphics library.</p>
      <p>It can model gravity, electromagnetism, pressure, and collisions between particles and trace their paths.</p>

<h1>My Side Hobbies</h1>
<div class="user">
  <div class="tech">
    <h2>Art</h2>
      <p>Other than a semester long art class I took in eighth grade, I am entirely self-taught.  I don't draw as much as I used to, and only really sculpt nowadays. But the practice has definitely paid off in my ability to visualize things in 3D, and of course the ability to make assets for my software. </p>
    <h2>Sculpting</h2>
      <img src="/assets/art/sculpting.png" alt="s1" style="width:500px;height:330px;">
      <p>I am entirely self-taught in sculpting. About a year ago, I was interested in trying it, so I ordered some clay on Amazon. Since then, I have been sculpting as a hobby.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="tech"><h2>Cartography</h2>
    <p>When I was younger, I hand-drew my own maps of the woods around my house, but eventually grew out of it. Now I use a GPS tracker to trace paths and mark waypoints, which I then combine with USGS maps I find online. It may not be as creative, but it's more accurate and actually usable, so way more practical.</p>
    <h2>Hiking and Spelunking</h2>
    <img src="/assets/art/cave.png" alt="s1" style="width:500px;height:330px;">
    <p>I have always loved hiking and mapping out forests, but recently I have become more interested in caving. After finding Thomas C. Barr's <u><i>Caves of Tennessee</i></u> online, I have been putting aside hours of my free time to hunt down and explore caves.</p>
